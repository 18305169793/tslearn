# Contributing

First of all, thank you for considering contributing to `tslearn`. 
It's people like you that will help make `tslearn` a great toolkit.

Contributions are managed through GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.

We are welcoming contributions in the following forms:
* **Bug reports**: when filing an issue to report a bug, please use the search tool to ensure the bug hasn't been reported yet;
* **New feature suggestions**: if you think `tslearn` should include a new algorithm, please open an issue to ask for it (of course, you should always check that the feature has not been asked for yet :). Think about linking to a pdf version of the paper that first proposed the method when suggesting a new algorithm. 
* **Bugfixes and new feature implementations**: if you feel you can fix a reported bug/implement a suggested feature yourself, do not hesitate to:
  1. fork the project;
  2. implement your bugfix;
  3. submit a pull request referencing the ID of the issue in which the bug was reported;

When submitting code, please think about code quality, adding proper docstrings including doctests with high code coverage.
